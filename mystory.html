                    <h1>My Story</h1>
                    <br>
                    <p>I've had a very eclectic training journey.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>It began with Mindful Wing Chun in 2016 after a friend randomly asked me to join him for a trial class, and things escalated quite quickly.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Once I was bitten by the martial arts bug, I turned to MMA, as that was the craze. UFC was in its upward swing and everyone was looking for an MMA class.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I discovered Versus Performance, helmed by Quinton Arendse, Phil McAlpine, and Michael 'Mikey' Dacuno. Here, I found my first proper fighting gym.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I was hooked from the start. In my first MMA class, I did something I've never done before. Grappling.The art of enforcing your will onto another person who is resisting as hard as they can. There is nothing like it. No disrespect to striking arts, but I fear the grapplers more than the strikers.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Versus is where my sparring and conditioning flourished. Muay Thai, boxing, wrestling, BJJ, MMA. All of these disciplines require a certain set of skills and while there are points at which they crossover, practicing so many arts at once was both exhilarating and extremely challenging.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>It was at Versus where I met a friend who introduced me to Chris Collins, recently of Ip Man 4 fame (as of the writing of this sentence). Chris teaches an eclectic mix of martial arts as well. Pekiti-Tirsia Kali (Philipino stick & knife-fighting), BJJ (Black Belt under Clark Gracie Jr.), Ving Tsun, boxing, and wrestling.</p>

        <!-- Part2 -->
        <section id="part2" class="whatwedo-section">
            <div class="container">
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-lg-12">
                    <p>Initially, I only made time to train Kali, as I was bitten by a different martial arts bug, weapon work. The same way being introduced to grappling changed my world, so too did learning stick & knife, but overtime, I will start training fulltime under Chris Collins, and I still am to this day.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Let's fast forward a few years. Injuries came and went, and I've also picked up a few hobbies along the way, such as yoga (Sandrine Alexander - Blue Door Studio, Clare Lim), parkour (Aaron Martin), movement (SharedSpace), and personal training (Ajay Patel).</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>While I never really stuck to these practices as I have with martial arts, I appreciate their lessons. Yoga gave me a true awareness of my body in motion and pushed my flexibility to its limits. Parkour and movement taught me the locomotive potential of the human body, and opened my eyes to the great variety of ways people can and can't move, and how everyone has their unique journey in movement. Personal training taught me how to endure; I have a notoriously weak grip, and through careful guidance, I was able to become a stronger and resilient practitioner of martial arts.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I save the best for last. During these few years of training and picking up hobbies, I ended up working in an actual Wing Chun studio! The first place that started it all was because my friend randomly came across a Wing Chun video and wanted company.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>It was not an easy job. Coming from an F&B import and distribution company, I've only ever spent time in the student side of the student-teacher relationship. But the team had the patience and the skills to help me find my way, and during my time in MWC, I became one of the core instructors for the Kids Kung Fu program.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Having taught so many young impressionable minds, and having seen the vast gradients of physical and mental attributes, witnessing their growth right in front of my eyes, it gave me a revelation. I am having a direct impact on their lives. Realizing the fact that they respect and trust me enough to listen and follow as I command was a life-changing moment.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I will leave you with one secret, and one last mention of someone who influenced me deeply. When I first started at MWC, I despised being around children. Babies, toddlers, little ones, not so little ones, I could not stand them. Think of my shock and surprise when it became a literal job description to deal with them!</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I was horrible in the beginning, but this was especially hard, and I owe my growth and success to one person, Chris Tannous. Chris never told me what to do, he always told me what I needed to do. He never said that what I'm doing is wrong, he provided alternatives to achieving the same goal based on his experience and understanding of the situation. He never asked me to change my approach and interpretation, he only suggested possible alternative ideas and points of view. Without his mentorship, ZHLMA would not exist.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>And that's it, you know everything! If you took the time to read all of that, I appreciate you taking the time to get to know me, and I hope I provided some small amount of entertainment or value with my words.</p>
